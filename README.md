# Coursework_OOP
The task was simple: to create a desktop application using any language (in my case - Java and JavaFX framework) that will perform every function described in button names 
(that's why the text in buttons is so long :)). Also, I used a bit of CSS for styling (which isn't great because I learned CSS in about an hour).
P. S.: I know, desktop applications aren't that popular or in demand at all, but that was our task. 
(Else I'd try to improve my Spring Boot knowledge and try to create some web application using databases)
